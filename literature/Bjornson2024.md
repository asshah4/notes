## Abstract
Background
Lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) is recognized as a causal factor for coronary heart disease (CHD) but its atherogenicity relative to that of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) on a per-particle basis is indeterminate.
Objectives
The authors addressed this issue in a genetic analysis based on the fact that Lp(a) and LDL both contain 1 apolipoprotein B (apoB) per particle.
Methods
Genome-wide association studies using the UK Biobank population identified 2 clusters of single nucleotide polymorphisms: one comprising 107 variants linked to Lp(a) mass concentration, the other with 143 variants linked to LDL concentration. In these Lp(a) and LDL clusters, the relationship of genetically predicted variation in apoB with CHD risk was assessed.
Results
The Mendelian randomization-derived OR for CHD for a 50 nmol/L higher Lp(a)-apoB was 1.28 (95% CI: 1.24-1.33) compared with 1.04 (95% CI: 1.03-1.05) for the same increment in LDL-apoB. Likewise, use of polygenic scores to rank subjects according to difference in Lp(a)-apoB vs difference in LDL-apoB revealed a greater HR for CHD per 50 nmol/L apoB for the Lp(a) cluster (1.47; 95% CI: 1.36-1.58) compared with the LDL cluster (1.04; 95% CI: 1.02-1.05). From these data, we estimate that the atherogenicity of Lp(a) is approximately 6-fold (point estimate of 6.6; 95% CI: 5.1-8.8) greater than that of LDL on a per-particle basis.
Conclusions
We conclude that the atherogenicity of Lp(a) (CHD risk quotient per unit increase in particle number) is substantially greater than that of LDL. Therefore, Lp(a) represents a key target for drug-based intervention in a significant proportion of the at-risk population.

> The plasma concentration of Lp(a) is regulated primarily by genetic factors and varies widely within populations and between ethnic groups.1  


  
> Because Lp(a) is formed by the covalent addition of apo(a) to apoB on LDL particles during the hepatic secretory process, it is conceptually possible to determine the number of circulating Lp(a) particles by assessing the contained apoB. ApoB is present in other lipoproteins, but by identifying genetic variants that uniquely affect Lp(a) levels, it should be possible to quantify genetically driven differences in apoB in Lp(a). A similar approach can be used to quantify genetically driven changes in apoB in LDL by using variants uniquely relatedtoLDL.  


*This is a fascinating method. It seems that be measuring the genetic variants associated with the "dose" of Lp(a) and LDL that contain apoB. These flavors of ApoB can then predict CHD risk (suggesting whether Lp(a) or LDL apoB is more atherogenic and dangerous).*

# Notes
%% begin notes %%
This article was particularly interesting because of the usage of a Mendelian randomization strategy to look at the differential effects of Lp(a) and LDL-c on overall CHD risk.
