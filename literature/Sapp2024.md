## Abstract
BACKGROUND From QEII Health Sciences Centre, Dal- The Resynchronization–Defibrillation for Ambulatory Heart Failure Trial (RAFT) housie University, Halifax, NS (J.L.S., showed a greater benefit with respect to mortality at 5 years among patients who R.P.), the Mazankowski Alberta Heart Institute, University of Alberta, Edmonton received cardiac-resynchronization therapy (CRT) than among those who received (S.S., S.K.), the University of Ottawa implantable cardioverter–defibrillators (ICDs). However, the effect of CRT on longHeart Institute, Ottawa (C.J.R., N.H.N.L., term survival is not known.

METHODS Cardiovascular Institute, Calgary, AB (D.V.E., We randomly assigned patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II G.S.), McMaster University, Hamilton, ON or III heart failure, a left ventricular ejection fraction of 30% or less, and an in(J.S.H.), Montreal Heart Institute, Montreal (B.T., B.M., M.T., J.R.), Royal Jubilee trinsic QRS duration of 120 msec or more (or a paced QRS duration of 200 msec Hospital, Victoria, BC (L.D.S.), and the or more) to receive either an ICD alone or a CRT defibrillator (CRT-D). We assessed University of Toronto, Toronto (S.M.) — long-term outcomes among patients at the eight highest-enrolling participating all in Canada; and King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia (A.M.).

RESULTS *A list of the RAFT Long-Term Study The trial enrolled 1798 patients, of whom 1050 were included in the long-term Team is provided in the Supplementary survival trial; the median duration of follow-up for the 1050 patients was 7.7 years Appendix, available at NEJM.org.

Death occurred in 405 of 530 patients (76.4%) assigned to the ICD group and in 370 of 520 patients (71.2%) assigned to the CRT-D group. The time until death appeared to be longer for those assigned to receive a CRT-D than for those assigned to receive an ICD (acceleration factor, 0.80; 95% confidence interval, 0.69 to 0.92; P = 0.002). A secondary-outcome event occurred in 412 patients (77.7%) in the ICD group and in 392 (75.4%) in the CRT-D group.
CONCLUSIONS Among patients with a reduced ejection fraction, a widened QRS complex, and NYHA class II or III heart failure, the survival benefit associated with receipt of a CRT-D as compared with ICD appeared to be sustained during a median of nearly 14 years of follow-up.

> The Resynchronization–Defibrillation for Ambulatory Heart Failure Trial (RAFT) was a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, controlled trial that aimed to determine whether the addition of CRT to an implantable cardioverter–defibrillator (ICD), along with optimal medical therapy, would result in lower mortality and fewer hospitalizations for heart failure than an ICD and optimal medical therapy alone.1  


*I'm curious as to the timing in terms of years and medication therapy that was offered. This effect of CRT may be lessened by that of other agents, like SGLT2i, ARNI, etc. The original study started in 2009, when these agents were not necessarily all available.*

  
> During a mean (±SD) of 40±20 months of follow-up for the 1798 enrolled patients, CRT resulted in a significantly lower risk of death or hospitalization for heart failure (the composite primary outcome) than ICD (hazard ratio, 0.75; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.64 to 0.87; P<0.001).  


*Once again, this is pre-ARNI and pre-SGLT2i, which means that the 25% reduction was essentially on BB and RAASi alone.*

  
> In order to estimate the treatment effect, we first examined the validity of the proportional-hazards assumption using plots of log of negative log of the estimated survival function,9 time-dependent covariates in the Cox model, and the empirical score process.  


*The empirical score process is essentially an evaluation of non-proportionality by transforming residuals. This uses the cumulative sum of the Martingale residuals.*

  
> Because of this possible violation of the proportional-hazards assumption and our prior knowledge of the likely shape of the baseline hazard, we adopted an exponential accelerated failure time model for our primary analysis, and we therefore present the estimates of the treatment effect as acceleration factors  


*Analysis using a non-proportional model, but an accelerated or <b>Weibull</b> distribution instead. They describe it as an accelerated model.*

*Estimates of the treatment effect (presented as acceleration factors) and 95% confidence intervals are shown for the primary outcome (death from any cause) in each prespecified subgroup. There was no plan for multiplicity in the statistical analysis, and the widths of the confidence intervals have not been adjusted for multiplicity. Thus, the confidence intervals should not be used to reject or not reject treatment effects. Estimated glomerular filtration rates were not available for nine patients. NIVCD denotes nonspecific intraventricular conduction delay, and NYHA New York Heart Association.*

- [ ] Review empirical score process by @Lin1993

In the statistical methods, they use the Empirical Score Process as an approach. 
@Lin1993 is purported to be done with __Martingale residuals__ and their cumulative sum.
Their forest plot of acceleration factors notes that for some reason, RBBB potentially has a better result than LBBB.
