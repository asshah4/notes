## Abstract
BACKGROUND Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is frequently performed to reduce the symptoms of stable angina. Whether PCI relieves angina more than a placebo procedure in patients who are not receiving antianginal medication remains unknown.
METHODS We conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of PCI in patients with stable angina. Patients stopped all antianginal medications and underwent a 2-week symptom assessment phase before randomization. Patients were then randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to undergo PCI or a placebo procedure and were followed for 12 weeks. The primary end point was the angina symptom score, which was calculated daily on the basis of the number of angina episodes that occurred on a given day, the number of antianginal medications prescribed on that day, and clinical events, including the occurrence of unblinding owing to unacceptable angina or acute coronary syndrome or death. Scores range from 0 to 79, with higher scores indicating worse health status with respect to angina.
RESULTS A total of 301 patients underwent randomization: 151 to the PCI group and 150 to the placebo group. The mean (±SD) age was 64±9 years, and 79% were men. Ischemia was present in one cardiac territory in 242 patients (80%), in two territories in 52 patients (17%), and in three territories in 7 patients (2%). In the target vessels, the median fractional flow reserve was 0.63 (interquartile range, 0.49 to 0.75), and the median instantaneous wave-free ratio was 0.78 (interquartile range, 0.55 to 0.87). At the 12-week follow-up, the mean angina symptom score was 2.9 in the PCI group and 5.6 in the placebo group (odds ratio, 2.21; 95% confidence interval, 1.41 to 3.47; P<0.001). One patient in the placebo group had unacceptable angina leading to unblinding. Acute coronary syndromes occurred in 4 patients in the PCI group and in 6 patients in the placebo group.

CONCLUSIONS Among patients with stable angina who were receiving little or no antianginal medication and had objective evidence of ischemia, PCI resulted in a lower angina symptom score than a placebo procedure, indicating a better health status with respect to angina.

> The evidence that PCI reduces angina comes from unblinded clinical trials1,4-6 in which the overall effect of PCI on symptoms is the result of a physical component as well as a placebo effect.7  


*Symptoms = PCI + Placebo... However, this is in setting of anti-anginal therapy.*

  
> However, it is possible that the absence of a difference between PCI and placebo was attributable to the high number of background antianginal medications.  


*Isn't antianginal medications the standard of care?*

  
> Medications with antianginal properties that patients were receiving for other clinical indications, such as heart failure or heart-rate control for atrial fibrillation, were continued and were incorporated in the statistical analysis.  


*Beta blockers are the most common on bith HF and AF, and are the strongest antianginal.*

  
> Asymptomatic patients were withdrawn from further participation in the trial.  


*Not sure if this is fair. If asymptomatic, or told that if they were asymptomatic, they would be withdrawn from the study. These patients may be more resilient, or have different characteristics and responses to intervention/placebo.*

  
> The sample size was determined on the basis of an assumed standard deviation of 6 angina symptom score units; we estimated that a sample of 284 patients would provide the trial with 80% power to detect a difference of 2 angina symptom score units between the PCI and placebo groups, using a Student’s t-test with an alpha level of 0.05.  


*One of the first clinical trials I have read that uses a minimum clinical difference to help identify power.*

  
> At the 12-week follow-up, the mean angina symptom score was 2.9 in the PCI group and 5.6 in the placebo group (odds ratio, 2.21; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.41 to 3.47; P<0.001) (Table 3 and Fig. 1A).

# Notes
%% begin notes %%
@Rajkumar2023 is an interesting study in that without anti-anginals, PCI seemed to provide better symptom control. However, unclear how many individuals were on beta-blockers for other reasons, such as AF or HF. 

Also, the anti-anginal units are not clear to me.
