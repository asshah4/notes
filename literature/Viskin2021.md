## Abstract
Polymorphic ventricular tachyarrhythmias are highly lethal arrhythmias. Several types of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia have similar electrocardiographic characteristics but have different modes of therapy. In fact, medications considered the treatment of choice for one form of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, are contraindicated for the other. Yet confusion about terminology, and thus diagnosis and therapy, continues. We present an in-depth review of the different forms of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia and propose a practical step-by-step approach for distinguishing these malignant arrhythmias.

> The onset of torsade de pointes is determined by 2 fundamental characteristics: (1) the first beat of the tachyarrhythmia denotes an early depolarization reaching trigger potential at the late phase of the prolonged action potential3 (consequently, the coupling interval [the time-interval between the last sinus complex, just before arrhythmia initiation and the first arrhythmia beat] is always long [>450 ms17 or ≥500 ms18 in different studies]); and (2) the abnormal QT fails to accommodate to sudden heart rate changes19,20 (consequently, torsade de pointes starts during sinus rate acceleration [tachycardia-dependent torsade17] or, more commonly, during heart rate deceleration [pause-dependent torsade21–23]).  


*In both types of <i>Tdp</i> the coupling interval is always long (>450-500 ms). <b>Tachycardia-dependent</b> types occur because the APD isn't accommodating accelerating sinus rates, which leads to <b>T-wave alternans.</b> <b>Pause-dependent</b> happens as the heart rate slows (or there is post-extrasystolic pause, which leads to an augmented EAD. This is more common and leads to the "short-long-short" coupling interval sequence.*

*<b>A</b> and <b>B</b>, Pause-dependent torsade de pointes. Note the short-long-short sequence created by extrasystoles and their postextrasystolic pause (annotated S-l-S), preceding torsade de pointes. Comparison of the baseline QT (blue arrowhead) and the postpause QT interval (red arrowhead) in <b>A</b> clearly demonstrates the maladaptation of the QT interval to sudden decrease in heart rate secondary to the postextrasystolic pause. <b>B</b>, Drug-induced long QT syndrome from methadone and erythromycin; the abnormal (notched) T-waves reflect early depolarizations (green arrowhead). The coupling interval of the beat initiating torsade de pointes is long (coupling interval, 705 ms [marked CI=705] in panel B). <b>C</b>, Tachycardia-induced torsade in an infant with congenital long QT syndrome. Note the macroscopic T-wave alternans (arrows of different colors) caused by the maladaptation of the QT interval to the accelerating heart rate immediately preceding torsade de pointes.*

This article by @Viskin2021 is a good review paper for both the coupling intervals and the types of polymorphpic VT.
