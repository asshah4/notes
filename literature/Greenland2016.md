## Abstract
Controlling for too many potential confounders can lead to or aggravate problems of data
sparsity or multicollinearity, particularly when the number of covariates is large in
relation to the study size. As a result, methods to reduce the number of modelled
covariates are often deployed. We review several traditional modelling strategies,
including stepwise regression and the ‘change-in-estimate’ (CIE) approach to deciding
which potential confounders to include in an outcome-regression model for estimating
effects of a targeted exposure. We discuss their shortcomings, and then provide some basic
alternatives and refinements that do not require special macros or programming.
Throughout, we assume the main goal is to derive the most accurate effect estimates
obtainable from the data and commercial software. Allowing that most users must stay
within standard software packages, this goal can be roughly approximated using basic
methods to assess, and thereby minimize, mean squared error (MSE).
