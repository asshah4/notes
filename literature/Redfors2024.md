## Abstract
Background
In the ISCHEMIA (International Study of Comparative Health Effectiveness with Medical and Invasive Approaches) trial, the risk of ischemic events was similar in patients with stable coronary artery disease treated with an invasive (INV) strategy of angiography and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or surgical (coronary artery bypass grafting [CABG]) coronary revascularization and a conservative (CON) strategy of initial medical therapy.
Objectives
The authors analyzed separately the outcomes of INV patients treated with PCI or CABG.
Methods
Patients without preceding primary outcome events were categorized as INV-PCI or INV-CABG from the time of revascularization. The ISCHEMIA primary outcome (composite of cardiovascular death, protocol-defined myocardial infarction or hospitalization for unstable angina, heart failure, or resuscitated cardiac arrest) was used.
Results
Among INV-CABG patients, primary outcome events occurred in 84 of 512 (16.4%) at a median follow-up of 2.85 years; 48 events (57.1%) occurred within 30 days after CABG, including 40 procedural MIs. Among INV-PCI patients, primary outcome events occurred in 147 of 1,500 (9.8%) at median follow-up of 2.94 years; 31 of which (21.1%) occurred within 30 days after PCI, including 24 procedural MIs. In comparison, 352 of 2,591 CON patients (13.6%) had primary outcome events at a median follow-up of 3.2 years, 22 of which (6.3%) occurred within 30 days of randomization. The adjusted primary outcome risks were higher after both CABG and PCI within 30 days (HR: 16.25 [95% CI: 11.44-23.07] and HR: 2.99 [95% CI: 1.97-4.53]) and lower thereafter (0.63 [95% CI: 0.44-0.89] and 0.66 [95% CI: 0.53-0.82]).
Conclusions
In ISCHEMIA, early revascularization by PCI and CABG was associated with higher early risks and lower long-term risks of cardiovascular events compared with CON. The early risk was greatest after CABG, owing to protocol-defined procedural MIs.

> I n patients with chronic coronary artery disease and moderate or severe ischemia enrolled in the ISCHEMIA (International Study of Comparative Health Effectiveness with Medical and Invasive Approaches) trial, there was no difference in the risk of ischemic events between an initial invasive strategy (INV) and an initial conservative strategy (CON) over a median followup period of 3.2 years.1 Revascularization was performed in 2,054 patients in the INV arm of ISCHEMIA, of whom 1,524 (74.1%) underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and 530 (25.8%) underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).  


*"Average" primary outcomes over a time period were similar, but based on strata of intervention type, appears to be different by both time and intervention.*

*(A) Myocardial infarction (any). (B) Spontaneous myocardial infarction. (C) Type 1 myocardial infarction. (D) Hospitalization for unstable angina, cardiac arrest, or heart failure. (E) All-cause death. (F) Cardiovascular death. (G) Stroke. Time to occurrence of a first event from the time of revascularization for patients in the INV arm who were treated with CABG and PCI as the first revascularization procedure without having a preceding event (INV-CABG and INV-PCI), and from randomization for patients in the INV arm who were treated medically and for patients in the CON arm. Patients in the INV arm who were revascularized without a preceding primary outcome event contribute data to both the INV-MED group (from randomization until they underwent revascularization) and either the INV-CABG or INV-PCI group (from the time of their first revascularization in patients without a preceding event). Note that the INV-MED and CON groups are accurately represented in that they start at the time of randomization and continue until censoring either because of an event, lost-to-follow-up, or shift in group from INV-MED to either INV-CABG or INV-PCI. In contrast, the timing of revascularization in the INV-CABG or INV-PCI varied (median 44 days [Q1-Q3: 24-88 days] for INV-CABG and 22 days [Q1-Q3: 11-41 days] for INV-PCI). Their Kaplan-Meier hazard is arbitrarily displayed from time zero regardless as to the time of revascularization for display purposes. Thus, the x-axis label is correctly expanded to “Time (months) after randomization for CON and INV-MED and time after revascularization for INV-CABG and INV-PCI.” CON ¼ conservative group; INV-CABG ¼ invasive group-coronary artery bypass grafting; INV-MED ¼ invasive group-medical management; INV-PCI ¼ invasive group-percutaneous coronary intervention.*

*Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression modeling group status as a time-adjusted covariate (such that a patient in the INV arm is categorized as INV-MED from randomization until revascularization; INV-MED patients were then moved to the PCI or CABG group at the time of revascularization if they did not experience a primary outcome event before revascularization. aAdjusted for the following covariate set: age, sex, prior MI, current smoking, diabetes, left ventricular ejection fraction <45%, prior CABG, prior heart failure hospitalization, chronic lung disease, prior stroke, known peripheral vascular disease, White vs non-White race, and estimated glomerular filtration rate of <60 mL/min. Note that the estimate for INV-MED is different in the “Overall” and “Time segmented” model as a consequence of the different estimates for INV-CABG and INV-PCI in the different models.*

# Notes

Interestingly, this approach changes early events from late events (>30 days), as well as by revascularization strategy.
This suggests to me that intervention reduces longer term MACE, however procedural complications/MI are of critical importance in the initial post-procedure period.
