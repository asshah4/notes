Boaz Avitall, MD, PhD, FACC, FHRS, description provided from the [UIC website](https://hospital.uillinois.edu/find-a-doctor/boaz-avitall)

> An internationally known pioneer and inventor, Dr. Avitall's interests include heart rhythm monitoring and management, ablation of cardiac arrhythmia, pacemakers and defibrillators, and cardiac electrophysiology ablation technologies. He holds numerous patents in cardiac arrhythmia ablation and has published extensively on the subject.  The first researcher to test endocardial atrial fibrillation ablation, he introduced linear ablation technology to the field of atrial fibrillation ablation.  He also invented and was the first to examine the applicability of cryoballoon technology to the treatment of atrial fibrillation, which led to this technology becoming a commonly used approach to ablate atrial fibrillation. Dr. Avitall has done extensive work on the long-term harmful impact of chronic atrial fibrillation.
