I will apply for the K23 award sometime in 2025 and/or 2026. 
This should be a continuation of my [T32 and F32 Research Years](T32%20and%20F32%20Research%20Years.md) in terms of topics. 
As its a training grant, the areas of research need to be somewhat innovative but more importantly have areas to be trained in.

I will need to build off of strengths from previous research mentors and the institution and new/active mentors. 
Particularly, I will need to reference the [University of Utah Research](University%20of%20Utah%20Research.md) opportunities.


# Big hairy audacious goal

zhe **BHAG**, as described by [Emelia J. Benjamin, MD, ScM](Emelia%20J.%20Benjamin,%20MD,%20ScM.md) from the AFGen fellowship, is the big picture that I need to be working towards in my research efforts.
My area of interest is in how stress can precipitate arrhythmia.
Stress physiology is complex, and involves the entirety of the neurocardiac axis. 
What I want to focus on is how, mechanistically, stress changes electrophysiological properties locally and how that leads to a propensity for arrhythmia.

My focus is more so on AF as a model disease, as it has multiple "flavors" (vagally-mediated, adrenergically-mediated, etc), multiple phenotypes, and fits well with the *Coumel's triangle* of arrhythmology.

# Specific aims

I need to break apart my __BHAG__ into a overarching hypothesis that leads me towards it, as it needs to be a small enough project that can be tested and finished within 5 years (at 50% protected time).
The hypothesis then needs to be approached using 3-4 specific aims, building on my skills and prior research.

- Signal processing: ECG and EGM data
- Biostatistics: statistical analyses, recurrent events
- Harmonic regression: cosinor analysis
- Computational genetics: Ensembl-VEP software, rare variant analysis
- Coding/programming: R, MATLAB, Python
- Electrophysiology procedures: animal and human studies, access to specific EP data

My overall interest is in using the K23 to explore how research can be performed in the EP lab, while also advancing my skills in epidemiology, signal processing, and genetics. 
These aims need to be related but independent, and will use atrial fibrillation as the model disease. 

1. Phenotype AF based on ECG, echo, and MRI parameters to evaluate progression. Utah Database + AF registry. 
2. EP lab to look at differences in stress / functional repolarization abnormalities during AF mapping. EP lab. Needs patients with minimal AF burden prior to start.
3. Mendelian randomization to evaluate phenotypes of AF risk using AFGen consortium data, UK Biobank, Utah Population Database based on subphenotype. Would need to confirm and explore genetic variants in the Stress Reactivity dataset from Emory.



# Mentorship, Coaching, and Sponsorship

I have started developing a research and mentorship network that will be critical for this project. I will need a key sponsor to "fund" my work, and other field-specific mentors.
