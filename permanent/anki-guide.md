[Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) is a spaced repetition program, which I am attempting to use to help maintain a life-long learning approach by focusing attention on things I *ought* to remember.  
This is one of the many __meta__ files, like the vault [README](../README.md) file.

# Structure

# Labels

## Flags

I use flags to help understand to give attention to a card after its been reviewed.

- <font color='turquoise'>Turquoise</font> is for cards that have further learning opportunities and other cards expanding on the topic should be added.
- <font color='red'>Red</font> is for cards that are **wrong** about an answer and need to be fixed to avoid learning something incorrectly.
- <font color='orange'>Orange</font> is for cards that could be re-structured or re-worded to be more clear. 
- <font color='blue'>Blue</font> cards need to have grammatical corrections made, similar to the underlined squiggles in Microsoft Word.
