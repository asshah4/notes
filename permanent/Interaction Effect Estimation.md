In the [[../docs/Computational/{vlndr}|{vlndr}]] software package, one simple concept is that of evaluating interaction. 

When evaluating a model that contains interaction terms, particularly categorical interaction terms, we can assess the interaction estimates on each level of the term.

For example, in the case of two binary variables $x_{1}$ and $x_{2}$, we can assess their interaction as:

$$
y = \beta_{0}x_{0} + \beta_{1}x_{1} + \beta_{2}x_{2} + \beta_{3}x_{1}x_{2}
$$
