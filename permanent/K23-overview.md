I will apply for the K23 award sometime in 2025 and/or 2026. 
This should be a continuation of my [T32-and-F32-research-years](T32-and-F32-research-years.md) in terms of topics. 
As its a training grant, the areas of research need to be somewhat innovative but more importantly have areas to be trained in.

I will need to build off of strengths from previous research mentors and the institution and new/active mentors. 
Particularly, I will need to capitalize on the [University-of-Utah-research](University-of-Utah-research.md) research opportunities.

# Big hairy audacious goal

The __BHAG__, as described by [Emelia-J-Benjamin-MD-ScM](Emelia-J-Benjamin-MD-ScM.md) from the AFGen fellowship, is the big picture that I need to be working towards in my research efforts.
My area of interest is in how stress can precipitate arrhythmia.
Stress physiology is complex, and involves the entirety of the neurocardiac axis. 
What I want to focus on is how, mechanistically, stress changes electrophysiological properties locally and how that leads to a propensity for arrhythmia.

My focus is more so on AF as a model disease, as it has multiple "flavors" (vagally-mediated, adrenergically-mediated, etc), multiple phenotypes, and fits well with the *Coumel's triangle* of arrhythmology.
I will have to be more specific at the level of a K23 award, but it should be focused on the above __BHAG__.

# Mentorship, Coaching, and Sponsorship

I have started developing a research and mentorship network that will be critical for this project. I will need a key sponsor to "fund" my work, and other field-specific mentors.

# Specific aims

I need to break apart my __BHAG__ into a overarching hypothesis that leads me towards it, as it needs to be a small enough project that can be tested and finished within 5 years (at 50% protected time).
The hypothesis then needs to be approached using 3-4 specific aims, building on my skills and prior research.

- Signal processing: ECG and EGM data
- Biostatistics: statistical analyses, recurrent events
- Harmonic regression: cosinor analysis
- Computational genetics: Ensembl-VEP software, rare variant analysis
- Coding/programming: R, MATLAB, Python
- Electrophysiology procedures: animal and human studies, access to specific EP data

My overall interest is in using the K23 to explore how research can be performed in the EP lab, while also advancing my skills in epidemiology, signal processing, and genetics. 
These aims need to be related but independent, and will use atrial fibrillation as the model disease. 

Working Titles:

- Substrate and ion channel-mediated phenotypes of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation
- Autonomic-mediation of atrial fibrillation pathways

Potential aim ideas:

1. Phenotype AF based on ECG, echo, and MRI parameters to evaluate progression. Utah Database + AF registry. 
2. EP lab to look at differences in stress / functional repolarization abnormalities during AF mapping. EP lab. Needs patients with minimal AF burden prior to start.
3. Mendelian randomization to evaluate phenotypes of AF risk using AFGen consortium data, UK Biobank, Utah Population Database based on subphenotype. Would need to confirm and explore genetic variants in the Stress Reactivity dataset from Emory.

1. Identify electrocardiographic phenotypes of paroxysmal AF with structurally normal atria.
2. [Determine the electrophysiological characteristics of sympathetically-mediated paroxysmal AF.]{.red}
3. Evaluate the role of genetic variants in cardiovagal receptors in sympathetically-mediated paroxysmal AF.

- APD variability in the atria precede onset of AF at rapid pacing rates [@vanStaveren2020]
- AERP measurement durnig extrastimuli protocols (e.g. bottom quintile of fibrillatory intervals from endocardium) [@Capucci1995]
- Two studies that have looked at mental stress and EPS are quite small (`n = 10` & `n = 12`), but neither looked at atrial properties [@Insulander2003; @Finlay2016]


1. Measure of EPS parameters during mental stress: evaluate HRV changes and intracardiac changes simultaneously 
1. Measure neuropeptide Y, epinephrine, and galanin levels before, during, and after
1. Cardiac autonomic modulation with vagal stimulation $\pm$ atropine during EPS
1. 24-hour Holter monitor before and after AF ablation to assess changes in ANS, and potentially more distant recordings to assess "autonomic recovery"
