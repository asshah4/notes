I will apply for the K23 award sometime in 2025 and/or 2026. 
This should be a continuation of my [T32-and-F32-research-years](T32-and-F32-research-years.md) in terms of topics. 
As its a training grant, the areas of research need to be somewhat innovative but more importantly have areas to be trained in.

I will need to build off of strengths from previous research mentors and the institution and new/active mentors. 
Particularly, I will need to capitalize on the [University-of-Utah-research](University-of-Utah-research.md) research opportunities.

Notes: 
- Relevant literature for review in [K23-background](K23-background.md) 
- Potential dataset information and descriptions in[K23-data](K23-data.md)

# Big hairy audacious goal

The __BHAG__, as described by [Emelia-J-Benjamin-MD-ScM](Emelia-J-Benjamin-MD-ScM.md) from the AFGen fellowship, is the big picture that I need to be working towards in my research efforts.
My area of interest is in how stress can precipitate arrhythmia.
Stress physiology is complex, and involves the entirety of the neurocardiac axis. 
What I want to focus on is how, mechanistically, stress changes electrophysiological properties locally and how that leads to a propensity for arrhythmia.

My focus is more so on AF as a model disease, as it has multiple "flavors" (vagally-mediated, adrenergically-mediated, etc), multiple phenotypes, and fits well with the *Coumel's triangle* of arrhythmology.
I will have to be more specific at the level of a K23 award, but it should be focused on the above __BHAG__.

# Mentorship, Coaching, and Sponsorship

I have started developing a research and mentorship network that will be critical for this project. I will need a key sponsor to "fund" my work, and other field-specific mentors.

# Specific aims

I need to break apart my __BHAG__ into a overarching hypothesis that leads me towards it, as it needs to be a small enough project that can be tested and finished within 5 years (at 50% protected time).
The hypothesis then needs to be approached using 3-4 specific aims, building on my skills and prior research.

- Signal processing: ECG and EGM data
- Biostatistics: statistical analyses, recurrent events
- Harmonic regression: cosinor analysis
- Computational genetics: Ensembl-VEP software, rare variant analysis
- Coding/programming: R, MATLAB, Python
- Electrophysiology procedures: animal and human studies, access to specific EP data

My overall interest is in using the K23 to explore how research can be performed in the EP lab, while also advancing my skills in epidemiology, signal processing, and genetics. 
These aims need to be related but independent, and will use atrial fibrillation as the model disease. 

## Working Titles (in likelihood order)

- Substrate and Ion Channel-Mediated Phenotypes of Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation
- Autonomic-Mediation of Atrial Fibrillation Pathways
- Drivers of Triggered Episodes of Paroxysaml Atrial Fibrillation
- Substrate and Triggered Drivers of Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation Phenotypes
- Substrated-Based Phenotypes of Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation

## Potential aims

The aims are oriented around different topics, methodologies, and datasets that may be available. 
There looks to be three major themes here that *pull together* my aims - there is a __mapping__ oriented aim in the EP lab, a __ECG__ based aim looking at phenotypic differences based on genetics (and null variants), and an exploratory aim on __novel variants__. 

1. Structural/substrate-based phenotypes of AF: Image-guided focus, using substrate/voltage maps during EP study, in addition to CMR, ECG data to evaluate overall clinical trajectory. Retrospective, combining Utah and UIC datasets.
1. Repolarization and depolarization abnormalities in AF: Prospective approach to mapping in EP lab. Study monophasic action potentials in paroxysmal AF cases undergoing ablation. Evaluate under influence of isoproterenol $\pm$ atropine $\pm$ vagal stimulation. Why? Assess repolarization abnormalities and affect of stress/triggers on AF threshold. 
1. *Wild-type* and *mutant* ECG patterns of paroxysmal AF: Relationship of monogenic variants in AF with changes in substrate pathology and ion channel remodeling in categorization AF subtypes. Can evaluate the ECG-based association with specific "substrate" genes and "ion channel" genes, and "wild-type" AF. See if ECG patterns can categorize patients utilizing UIC dataset, and UK Biobank.  This extends the [ECG-prediction-of-TTN-variants](ECG-prediction-of-TTN-variants.md)
1. Mendelian randomization of triggered arrhythmias: Look at Emory HRV stress reactivity data, and evaluate association with common/rare variants in GWAS data. Then, test association of these rare variants with future arrhythmia risk (both in local Emory data) and in UK Biobank.
