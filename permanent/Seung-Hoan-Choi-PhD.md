Seung Hoan Choi, PhD is one of the [AFGen-fellowship](../permanent/AFGen-fellowship.md) mentors for the 2023-2024 year, and has published extensively with the AFGen consortium. He co-mentors with [Emelia-J-Benjamin-MD-ScM](../permanent/Emelia-J-Benjamin-MD-ScM.md). 

This description is from the [Boston University](https://www.bu.edu/sph/profile/seung-hoan-choi/) website.

> Dr. Choi's work is at the interface of statistics and genetics, developing and applying statistical methods to further our understanding of the genetics of complex diseases. He has developed his analytic capabilities in genetics, statistics, and large-scale data processing. Dr. Choiâ€™s recent work has used this foundation to elucidate the genetic basis of a common and complex disease, atrial fibrillation. He has led or contributed to many important findings in cardiometabolic genetics and is considered a key investigator in the field.

> Dr. Choi received his PhD in Biostatistics from Boston University School of Public Health in 2016 with his focused research in statistical genetics. He then completed a postdoctoral fellowship at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard. He also previously held the position of Computational Scientist II at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard.
