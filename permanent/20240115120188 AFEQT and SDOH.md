Thinking about how to structure the AFEQT paper
Results section:

Need to think about type of analyses
Should we adjust for other variables?
Comorbidity score?

to Darbar. 

# Overview

The AFEQT scores are measured at baseline and at follow-up
Clinically, patients are managed based on symptoms and then treatment offered
However, we hypothesized that SDOH factors may affect treatment decisions
In a study like this, we would need to define informative tables and figures
This is based on our DAG model and the roles of variables

Exposures:

	NDI, quartiles 
	Race/Ethnicity
	Language
	Insurance
	Gender/Sex
	
Outcomes:
	
	AFEQT score changes
	Treatment escalation (increased dosage)
	Change from rate to rhythm control strategy
	Referral for intervention (EP, TEE, PVI)
	Anticoagulation recommendations (DOAC v. warfarin)

Confounders:

	Age
	CHA2DS2VASC score
	Clinical comorbidities (composite score?)
	Stroke, previous or new

# TABLES & FIGURES

The overall list of figures and tables need to reflect these decisions
Information must show the type of patient population present

Table 1: cohort description

	Key grouping by at time of AFEQT baseline
	Rate versus rhythm control strategy 
	Divide by major outcome of AFEQT score change (not standard approach)
