We were introduced in 2016 at Emory while I was an intern due to research interest in heart rate variability. 
Amit's interest are in epidemiology, cardiovascular prevention, and autonomic nervous system function. 
He works with signal processing and the computational labs at Emory although is primarily active as a non-invasive cardiologist and epidemiology faculty.
