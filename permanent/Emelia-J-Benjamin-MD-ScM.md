One of the faculty mentors for the AFGen fellowship, and a member of the AFGen Consortium. 
I served as an AFGen felow in 2023-2024, where I met and started to work with her. 
She seems to have a background in epidemiology, genetics, and mentorship.
She has also authored several papers on the importance of social determinants in cardiovascular research.
