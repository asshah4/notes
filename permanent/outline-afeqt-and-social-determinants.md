# Introduction

## Relevance/Importance

- need for SDOH in AF research

@Benjamin2023, at a NHLBI workshop, states...

> The workshop addressed the following social determinants: (1) socioeconomic status and access to care; (2) health literacy; (3) race, ethnicity, and racism; (4) sex and gender; (5) shared decision-making in systemically disadvantaged populations; and (6) place, including rurality, neighborhood, and community. 

- Critical need and gap in knowledge of how __social determinants of health (SDOH) affect management and outcomes in atrial fibrillation (AF)__ [@Essien2021]
- Racial differences in AF burden/symptoms [@Norby2021], as well as outcomes [@Magnani2016]
- Under-representation of minority populations in AF clinical trials [@Sarraju2020]

## Background Literature

- importance of symptoms in AF management
- diversity in how AF is assessed/evaluated and managed
- Symptoms in AF are variable [@Darbar2005] and maybe more important burden alone

## Purpose

__Objective__: *Evaluate the role of SDOH in AF symptom burden and quality-of-life.*

__Hypothesis__: *We hypothesize that...*

1. Social determinants of health negatively effect AF symptom burden and quality-of-life, regardless of clinical risk factors or treatment strategy.
1. Social determinants of health are associated with treatment strategies/opportunities, regardless of clinical risk factors.

# Methods

## Study Population

The UIC Multi-Ethnic AF Registry is highly enriched for minority populations, including Black/African-American and Hispanic/Latinx race-ethnicities

- Inclusion criteria: age > 18 years, paroxysmal AF at time of enrollment
- AFEQT measured at enrollment and follow-up (approximately 12 months)

## Atrial Fibrillation Effect on Quality-of-Life Scores

The Atrial Fibrillation Effect on Quality-of-Life (AFEQT) is a validated questionnaire that measures the impact of atrial fibrillation on quality-of-life.

- Total subscale
- Symptoms subscale
- Activites subscale
- Treatment subscale

*Treatment concerns were not included in this analysis due to incomplete responses.*

## Social Determinants of Health

- Reported sex/gender identity
- Self-reported race (validated by ancestral markers in subset of patients)
- Self-reported ethncity
- National Deprivation Index (NDI)
- Insurance type
- Primary spoken language
- Marital status

## Statistical analysis

- Descriptive statistics of cohort characteristics
- Multivariable linear regression models to evaluate the association of SDOH with AFEQT scores
- Models adjusted for clinical risk factors and treatment strategy

# Results

## Cohort description

- cross-sectional cohort
- longitudinal cohort (subset)
- difference in cohorts by NDI and race (and other SDOH factors)

## Effects on AFEQT

- cross-sectional analysis
- linear regression models 
- rhythm/rate control strategies at baseline

- NDI Q4 has worse total AFEQT regardless of clinical risk factors (dose-dependent)
- NDI Q4 was worse AFEQT regardless of rate/rhythm strategy (including non-pharmacological rhythm interventions)
- Black race has worse total AFEQT regardless of clinical risk factors
- Black race also had worse AFEQT regardless of treatment strategy (including non-pharmacological rhythm interventions)
- Spanish speakers had improvement in activity AFEQT score on follow-up

## Rate and Rhythm Control Strategies

- cross-sectional analysis
- linear regression models 
- NDI Q4 had high odds of starting in rate-control strategy
- Black race had decreased odds of being in rhythm control strategy at baseline or at follow-up time period
- Public insurance had higher odds of switching to rhythm control by follow-up
- Spanish speakers had higher odds of being on rate-control strategy at followup
- Men had higher odds of being on rhythm control strategy compared to women (known phenomenon)

# Discussion

## Limitations

- retrospective cohort
- lack of validation externally
- imbalanced data from UIC and JBVA
- ICD/chart review based
- lack of complete data in education, income

## Conclusion

# Tables & Figures

The figures and tables for this paper need to be thoughtful analyses of the major relationships we hope to show.

1. Table = cohort description by AFEQT score changes, with sections on clinical covariates, social determinants, treatment strategies, etc
1. Figure or Table = AFEQT score breakdown in the population, with subscales (bar graph), showing score changes
1. Table = Regression models with the primary exposure(s) being the SDOH factors, with sequential adjustment for traditional risk factors. Each column represents one exposure, with AFEQT changes as the outcome variable (with additional outcomes by AFEQT subscales).  
1. Table = Regression models for rhythm/rate control strategy decisions by SDOH factors as primary exposure(s).
