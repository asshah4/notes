# Introduction

## Relevance/Importance

- need for SDOH in AF research

@Benjamin2023, at a NHLBI workshop, states...

> The workshop addressed the following social determinants: (1) socioeconomic status and access to care; (2) health literacy; (3) race, ethnicity, and racism; (4) sex and gender; (5) shared decision-making in systemically disadvantaged populations; and (6) place, including rurality, neighborhood, and community. 

- Critical need and gap in knowledge of how __social determinants of health (SDOH) affect management and outcomes in atrial fibrillation (AF)__ [@Essien2021]
- Racial differences in AF burden/symptoms [@Norby2021], as well as outcomes [@Magnani2016]
- Under-representation of minority populations in AF clinical trials [@Sarraju2020]

## Background Literature

- importance of symptoms in AF management
- diversity in how AF is assessed/evaluated and managed
- Symptoms in AF are variable [@Darbar2005] and maybe more important burden alone
- Difference of AF and paradox by race [@Stamos2016]
- Review of AF in Nature by @Lip2016
- @Magnani2016 describes differences in AF disease mortality in ARIC
- @Essien2021 shows SDOH gap in AF management/outcomes

- @Gisi2020 is a paper by Magnani on `n=260` individuals with AFEQT and depression, showing stepwise relationship between depression and AFEQT
- @Katsumata2020 showed that physicians under-reported (estimated) symptom burden, primarily in elderly patients and in men (however in Japanese cohort), and additionally along with Spertus (by @Ikemura2024) showed that physician often underestimate or overestimate AFEQT, leading to inappropriate or lack of treatment escalation
- @Randolph2016 noted that some clinical factors, such as female sex, heart failure, OSA, COPD, etc were associated with reduced AFEQT. This was in `n=2007` patients, but no one looked at social determinants
- PRO study by @Guhl2019 showed that lower income was associated with worse AFEQT
- A meta-analysis of PRO by @Steinberg2019 showed that only 14% of AF studies included PROs, and of those studies, 17% only had AFEQT or AF-specific QOL measure


@Holmes2019 showed that AFEQT scores mattered > 5 change

## Purpose

__Objective__: *Evaluate the role of SDOH in AF symptom burden and quality-of-life.*

__Hypothesis__: *We hypothesize that...*

1. Social determinants of health negatively effect AF symptom burden and quality-of-life, regardless of clinical risk factors or treatment strategy.
1. Social determinants of health are associated with treatment strategies/opportunities, regardless of clinical risk factors.

# Methods

## Study Population

The UIC Multi-Ethnic AF Registry is highly enriched for minority populations, including Black/African-American and Hispanic/Latinx race-ethnicities

- UIC + JBVA recruitment (multicenter) with clinical and genetics as a registry of AF patients
- Inclusion criteria: age > 18 years, paroxysmal AF at time of enrollment
- AFEQT measured at enrollment and follow-up (approximately 12 months)
- Recruitment approach

## Atrial Fibrillation Effect on Quality-of-Life Scores

The Atrial Fibrillation Effect on Quality-of-Life (AFEQT) is a validated questionnaire that measures the impact of atrial fibrillation on quality-of-life.

- Total subscale
- Symptoms subscale
- Activites subscale
- Treatment subscale

*Treatment concerns were not included in this analysis due to incomplete responses.*

- @Holmes2019 showed a >5 change in AFEQT was clinically significant

## Social Determinants of Health

- Reported sex/gender identity
- Self-reported race (validated by ancestral markers in subset of patients)
- Self-reported ethncity
- National Deprivation Index (NDI)
- Insurance type
- Primary spoken language
- Marital status

## Clinical history

- Clinical covariates
- Heart failure status and echocardiogram
- Medications, focused on rate/rhythm control agents (e.g. AAD)
- Medications, including AP/AC agents in terms of CHADSVASC risk scores
- Longitudinal follow-up data

## Statistical analysis

- Cohort characteristics
	- Descriptive characteristics of the cross-sectional cohort at baseline (by AFEQT quartile)
	- Descriptive characteristics of the longitudinal cohort at baseline (by AFEQT quartile)
	- Descriptive characteristics of the longitudinal cohort by SDOH factors (focusing on SDOH differences)
- Effects on AFEQT
	- Baseline AFEQT status and at follow-up
	- Describe mean change of AFEQT
	- Statistical and linear regression testing with SDOH with baseline AFEQT scores
		- Multivariable adjustment for traditional risk factors
	- Statistical and linear regression testing with SDOH for changes in future AFEQT
		- Adjusting for baseline AFEQT scores
		- Multivariable adjustment in sequential fashion with traditional risk factors
		- Adjusting for treatment strategies (cardioversion, PVI, etc)
- Treatment strategy
	- Description of treatment strategy
	- Statistical and logistic regression testing with SDOH for baseline and future treatment strategies
		- Multivariable adjustment in sequential fashion with traditional risk factors

# Results

## Cohort description

- cross-sectional cohort
- longitudinal cohort (subset)
- difference in cohorts by NDI and race (and other SDOH factors)

## Effects on AFEQT

- cross-sectional analysis
- linear regression models 
- rhythm/rate control strategies at baseline

- NDI Q4 has worse total AFEQT regardless of clinical risk factors (dose-dependent)
- NDI Q4 was worse AFEQT regardless of rate/rhythm strategy (including non-pharmacological rhythm interventions)
- Black race has worse total AFEQT regardless of clinical risk factors
- Black race also had worse AFEQT regardless of treatment strategy (including non-pharmacological rhythm interventions)
- Spanish speakers had improvement in activity AFEQT score on follow-up

## Rate and Rhythm Control Strategies

- cross-sectional analysis
- linear regression models 
- NDI Q4 had high odds of starting in rate-control strategy
- Black race had decreased odds of being in rhythm control strategy at baseline or at follow-up time period
- Public insurance had higher odds of switching to rhythm control by follow-up
- Spanish speakers had higher odds of being on rate-control strategy at followup
- Men had higher odds of being on rhythm control strategy compared to women (known phenomenon)


# Discussion

## Key findings

- SDOH factors, particularly ancestry + NDI quartile effect overall AFEQT scores (delta with time) regardless of basline clinical factors
- SDOH factors also effect relationship with rate/rhythm control strategy in the local community

## Supporting findings (from literature)


- @Meschia2010 noted that blacks less likely than whites to know if they have AF
- @Holmes2019 showed that $\pm$ 5 points was a clinically significant and meaningful difference in AFEQT scores

## Mechanisms underlying findings

## Clinical implications

- Rate and rhythm control strategies were similar in MACE in ORBIT-AF, however >90% of population was white [@Noheria2016]

## Future investigations

## Limitations

- cross-sectional data more robust then longitdunal data
- retrospective cohort
- lack of validation externally
- imbalanced data from UIC and JBVA
- ICD/chart review based
- lack of complete data in education, income

## Conclusion

# Tables & Figures

The figures and tables for this paper need to be thoughtful analyses of the major relationships we hope to show.

1. Table = cohort description by AFEQT score changes, with sections on clinical covariates, social determinants, treatment strategies, etc
1. Figure or Table = AFEQT score breakdown in the population, with subscales (bar graph), showing score changes
1. Table = Regression models with the primary exposure(s) being the SDOH factors, with sequential adjustment for traditional risk factors. Each column represents one exposure, with AFEQT changes as the outcome variable (with additional outcomes by AFEQT subscales).  
1. Table = Regression models for rhythm/rate control strategy decisions by SDOH factors as primary exposure(s).
