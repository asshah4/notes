The `{sWAVE}` package is being developed to extend the [R-EGM](../permanent/R-EGM.md) package.
The purpose is an annotation application for `egm` objects or plot objects from the supported annotation systems, in line with WFDB.

The development process is guided by the following resources:

- [Mastering Shiny](https://mastering-shiny.org/index.html) by Hadley Wickham
- [Engineering Production-Grade Shiny Apps](https://engineering-shiny.org/index.html) by Colin Fay

The relevant packages are:

- [`{shiny}`](https://shiny.posit.co/)
- [`{golem}`](https://thinkr-open.github.io/golem/index.html)
