Atrial fibrillation, in line with Coumel's triangle [@Coumel1994], seems to be a mix of atrial size, fibrosis, and autonomic influences.  
Large mammals are somewhat unique in that they have different mechanisms of rhythm regulation, although likely share significant overlap in structure and function with humans.
This note is an extension of the [[Comparative Cardiology]] note.
