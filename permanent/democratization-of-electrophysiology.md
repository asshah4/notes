After discussion with [Boaz-Avitall](Boaz-Avitall.md), writing an *opinion* piece about how the field has changed over the last 20+ years may be insightful.

Some important themes or elements in designing the outline, from our initial discussion:
- role of how CARTO has expanded from physician-led mapping to industry-led mappers/technicians
- how industry technicians and physicians interact (referencing an incident in New York where an orthopedic surgeon let a company rep "scrub in" to help with a case)
- importance of painting the transformation of the field in a positive light
- differences between device implantation and ablation in terms of the roles of industry reps and physician interaction (e.g. reps only come to device cases due to "stock" issues)
- an increasing number of younger individuals, who trained in a technology-savvy environment, are "flocking" to EP
- role of EP as the intersection of medicine and electrical engineering
  
These foundational conversations are helpful in __steering__ the manuscript and outline.
