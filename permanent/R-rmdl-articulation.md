The concept of an `articulation` is the underlying joinery between outcome and exposure (or any other predictor). 
The concept needs to be cover the contexts it may exist in to help create the `{gt}` tables for publications.
Here we brainstorm how to put that together.

Variable types:

- continuous
- categorical (ordered or unordered)
	- binary
	- multiple categories

Direction relationships:

- model estimates
- means
	- adjusted (e.g. `{emmeans}`)
- distributions

Contexts:

- strata
- interaction
- dataset differences
- covariates
	- sequential adjustment
