# Introduction

# History

## Founding of clinical cardiac electrophysiology

- First His bundle recording in 1969, and then in 1970s the role of EP diagnostic studies became common/were developed [@Feld1999] 
- Surgical ablation and management of SVT and VT begin in 1970s to 1980s [@Feld1999]
- Replaced in 1990s by RFA and usage of ICDs [@Feld1999]


- In 1996, @Ben-Haim1996 showed *in vivo* navigation and mapping was possible
- Subsequently, @Gepstein1997 showed the accuracy in comparative *in vitro* and *in vivo* models 
- Electrophysiology labs development of standards [@Haines2014], guidelines recommended by HRS in 2014

## Partnership with industry

- Recommendations on the role of industry representatives in the EP lab [@Lindsay2008]
	- Described as IEAP (industry employed allied professionals)
- Has evolved to cover a broad range of EP-related procedures/fields as defined in HRS statement by @Haines2023
	- Notably, the IEAP is not involved in "patient care"
	- Opinion: there is no feedback loop for those not directly involved in outcomes
- The need for certification to be an allied professional (either nurse or technologist) was growing as of 2010 [@Chiu2010]

- technology speed > physician education
- surgical reps in the operating room

# Democratization

## Role of industry in modern cardiac electrophysiology

- current role of industry
- devices compared with ablation (reps)
