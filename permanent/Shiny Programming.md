The `R` system for creating interactive plots and visualizations, called [Shiny](https://shiny.posit.co/), seems to be an appropriate fit for extending a feature in the [R-shiva](../docs/Computational/R-shiva.md) package. 
It would be a powerful tool to help annotate plots using an interactive graph, allowing for labeling of EGM data.

The general [guide to shiny](https://mastering-shiny.org/index.html)  shows that user *mouse-based input* can be used to help select points.
