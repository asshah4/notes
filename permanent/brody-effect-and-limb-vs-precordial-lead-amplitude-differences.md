When evaluating ECG, there is occasionally a difference in amplitude between the precordial leads and limb leads that is not easily explained by body habitus alone. 
This effect may represent dilated cardiomyopathy, as seen with volume overload and the Brody effect [@Rudy1978].

[Mladen-Ivo-Vidovich](Mladen-Ivo-Vidovich.md) and I discussed this is a potential project to better understand the precordial/coronal lead discrepancy - naming it "The Brody Effect Revisited" as a working title.
Using the ECG data at UIC from the [T32- and-F32-research-years](../permanent/T32-%20and-F32-research-years.md), may be able to classify precordial and limb lead voltage differences, and compare that with specific characteristics:

- cardiomyopathy status
- body habitus
- chest structure (COPD)

From a mathematical perspective, this is likely a combination of how bipolar and unipolar leads work and how they interact with different intrathoracic volumes.
