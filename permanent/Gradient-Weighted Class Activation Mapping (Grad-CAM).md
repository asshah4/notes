This technique is used to help understand and visualize how a prediction was made from a neural network. 
@Selvaraju2020a describe Grad-CAM as an approach, although this is focused on images. 
This technique is used in 1-dimensional image of ECG data in work by @vandeLeur2021.

This approach will need to be implemented in the [ECG-prediction-of-TTN-variants](ECG-prediction-of-TTN-variants.md) project.
