This technique is used to help understand and visualize how a prediction was made from a neural network. 
@Selvaraju2020a describe Grad-CAM as an approach, although this is focused on images. 
This technique is used in 1-dimensional image of ECG data in work by @vandeLeur2021.

This approach will need to be implemented in the [[ECG Prediction of TTN Variants|ECG Prediction of TTN Variants]] project.
