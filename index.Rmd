# Preface {-}

This initially was designed to help document exploratory concepts that were developed using the [card](https://asshah4.github.io/card) package, but also expanded to clinical concepts leveraging the power of R and Rmarkdown.

As this develops, it will likely create its own order. Currently it revolves around the principal components:

- circadian rhythm
- electrocardiography
- autonomic physiology
- clinical medicine
- programming
