# Outline

1. Introduction
1. Background


# Examples

Examples of the importance of cardiac sympathetic innervation are below:

- increased left ventricular pressures lead to risk of ventricular arrhythmias due to mechanoreceptor signals
- increased left atrial pressures in OSA/OHS increase the risk for atrial fibrillation, but unknown neurocardiac pathways
- post-ischemic reperfusion and ventricular arrhythmias
- coronary microvascular dysfunction and receptor saturation in the microvascular compartments
- stellate ganglion inputs into cardiac function, both arrhythmia and contractility
- sympathetic input leading to bradycardia with inappropriate vagal tone in stress testing (e.g. dobutamine)
