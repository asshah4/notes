Here is a collection of my shared notes, which use the *zettelkasten* method for linking between ideas and thoughts. Generally, I've organized my notes below based on areas that I find recurring in my academic life.

## Arrhythmia: molecular and genetic mechanisms 

## Computational: machine learning and signal processing methods 

## Epidemiology: biostatistics and stress physiology

## Cardiology: echocardiography and cardiac electrophysiology
