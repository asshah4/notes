Here is a collection of my shared notes, which use the zettelkasten method for linking between ideas and thoughts. Generally, I've organized my notes below as areas/ways to explore and brainstorm.

## Electrocardiography

This section is dedication to the majority of interesting ECG-based concepts as I uncover and learn about them.

## Epidemiology

With a background in biostatistic and epidemiology, this section is focused primarily on biostatistical thoughts and programming in R.

## Neurocardiology

This is my core area of interest and research, focused on how autonomic control regulates cardiac physiology.
