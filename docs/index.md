# Notes

Here are a collection of thoughts and notes on a variety of topics. I've used the [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) system for note taking in markdown, and collected these into topics as I read/write more. 

Current topic areas are:

- Electrocardiography
- Neurocardiology
- Programming
- Epidemiology
