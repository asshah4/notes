# Ideas

- Complete heart block after IE
- Tricuspid regurgitation and complete heart block
- Progressive first degree AV block with AV endocarditis

1. Gross anatomy
2. Conduction system anatomy
3. Neurocardiac and neurohormonal anatomy/functions
4. Infectious syndromes: pericarditis, myocarditis, endocarditis (pacemaker infections)
5. In hospital components: medications such as antibiotics, prolonged hospitalization and dysautonomia
6. Long-term arrhythmia burden (e.g. regurgitant valves and atrial fibrosis)
7. ECG components = arrhythmia, morphology changes, conduction system disease (e.g. block)
8. Management/treatment of arrhythmias
