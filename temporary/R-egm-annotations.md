This is a branch page from [R-EGM](../permanent/R-EGM.md) for considering the features of EGM for annotation purposes.

Universal features:

- A lead can represent bipolar or unipolar signals
- The maximum $\frac{dV}{dt}$ on a unipolar signal is the sharpest point on a bipolar signal, and represents the intrinsic/intrinsicoid deflection.
- Slower deflections on the bipolar recording represent non-local (e.g. farfield signals)
