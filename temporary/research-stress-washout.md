1. Arrhythmias occasionally develop after isoproterenol is washed out in midst of an EP study. Unclear why this occurs when its known that infusion is by itself a dose-dependent arrhythmogenic agent.
2. After stress testing, PVC and VT burden is more malignant in the recovery phase than during stress (either dobutamine or exercise).

High vagal nerve activity appears to be causal in atrial arrhythmias and atrial fibrillation, but moderately low levels of vagal nerve stimulation (that don't lead to bradycardia) seem to suppress PVI.  This is not necessarily the case with ventricular arrhythmias.

Why is there a difference between atrial versus ventricular arrhythmogenesis with vagal nerve stimulation?

Concepts:

- repolarization variability
- neuronal size of fibers correlates with myocyte size (sympathetic), leading to a Î²2-AR dependent trophic input
- optogenetic control of cardiac neuronal function

Ideas:

- isoproterenol and acetylcholine stimulation and EAD thresholds in patients with predisposing substrates ("conceptual trigger")
- look at heterogenous response of circuits in EAD depolarization
