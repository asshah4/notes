# Introduction

## Background 

@Benjamin2023, at a NHLBI workshop, states...

> The workshop addressed the following social determinants: (1) socioeconomic status and access to care; (2) health literacy; (3) race, ethnicity, and racism; (4) sex and gender; (5) shared decision-making in systemically disadvantaged populations; and (6) place, including rurality, neighborhood, and community.

- Critical need and gap in knowledge of how __social determinants of health (SDOH) affect management and outcomes in atrial fibrillation (AF)__ [@Essien2021]
- Racial differences in AF burden/symptoms [@Norby2021], as well as outcomes [@Magnani2016]
- Under-representation of minority populations in AF clinical trials [@Sarraju2020]

## Purpose

__Objective__: *Evaluate the role of SDOH in AF symptom burden and quality-of-life.*

__Hypothesis__: *We hypothesize that...*

1. Social determinants of health negatively effect AF symptom burden and quality-of-life, regardless of clinical risk factors or treatment strategy.
1. Social determinants of health are associated with treatment strategies/opportunities, regardless of clinical risk factors.

# Methods

## Cohort

The UIC Multi-Ethnic AF Registry is highly enriched for minority populations, including Black/African-American and Hispanic/Latinx race-ethnicities

- Inclusion criteria: age > 18 years, paroxysmal AF at time of enrollment
- AFEQT measured at enrollment and follow-up (approximately 12 months)

## SDOH factors

- Reported sex/gender identity
- Self-reported race (validated by ancestral markers in subset of patients)
- Self-reported ethncity
- National Deprivation Index (NDI)
- Insurance type
- Primary spoken language
- Marital status

## AFEQT

The Atrial Fibrillation Effect on Quality-of-Life (AFEQT) is a validated questionnaire that measures the impact of atrial fibrillation on quality-of-life.

- Total subscale
- Symptoms subscale
- Activites subscale
- Treatment subscale

*Treatment concerns were not included in this analysis due to incomplete responses.*

## Statistical analysis

- Descriptive statistics of cohort characteristics
- Multivariable linear regression models to evaluate the association of SDOH with AFEQT scores
- Models adjusted for clinical risk factors and treatment strategy
