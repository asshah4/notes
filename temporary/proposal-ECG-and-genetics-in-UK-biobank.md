# Current Literature

- @Verweij2020 looked at ECG and correlated it with GWAS for cardiac genetic variants
	- Used 80K ECG from UK Biobank and created single-beat based ECGs (stretched out to 500 samples per ECG)
	- GWAS against 10 million genetic variants
	- Found 300 genetic loci associated with the ECG
	- Also tested specific ECG traits (QT, PR, RR, QRS voltage, AF patterns, etc)

- @Holmqvist2015 showed that heart rate independently is associated with AF progression independent of underlying rhythm, suggesting that AV node health contributes to the AF trajectory

- @Weng2020 showed that there are genetic contributions to P wave duration with specific genetic variants, as its already known that PWD is associated with AF
	- Identified 21 common loci and 14 new loci associated with PWD, including sarcomere genes (*TTN* and *MYH6*)
	- Also found some variants that associated wiht longer PWD but lower AF risk

- @Libiseller-Egger2022 reviewed how ECG-based age was genetically associated with CVD phenotypes
		- Used UK Biobank to assess $\Delta age$ to identify novel loci - they found 8
		- This included genes like SCN5A and TTN, suggesting ECG-age is more likely a cardiovascular phenomenon

- @Husser2009 was a publication with [Dawood-Darbar-MD-MBChB](../permanent/Dawood-Darbar-MD-MBChB.md) and Roden which showed that in a small sample, certain genes in ion-channels associated with fibrillatory rates

- @Wang2023 looked if ECG could predict AF as well as genetic susceptibility
	- Used an ECG-AI model to predict incident AF from 40k UK Biobankers **without** known AF
	- Then did GWAS of predicted AF risk and compared it with AF-GWAS risk
	- Found ECG-AI correlated better with AF then clinical GWAS

- @Choi2020 looked at monogenic and polygenic contributions to AF risk, which found that polygenic factors seemed to increase the susceptibility to AF more than monogenic contributors alone

- @Choi2021 also published on ECG intervals to identify monogenic arrhythmia susceptibility genes
	- Found that normal ECG intervals identified potassium channel and sodium genes, all associated with AF

- @Tereshchenko2018 looked at GEH patterns in the ARIC and CHS study, and found that there were associations with GEH (GEH x GWAS)
	- ARIC + CHS has roughly 13k patients with ECG
