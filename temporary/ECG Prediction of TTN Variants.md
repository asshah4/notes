In this project, I hope to predict abnormalities in the TTN protein based on functional characterization using surface electrocardiogram.

This project has two major components: (1) Genetic assessment of TTN variants, both pathogenic and VUS subtypes, (2) ECG-based machine learning to predict the likelihood of a TTN variant. They will require effort on multiple fronts, with the goal of having presentation-ready data by early March of 2023 (prior to the AFGen fellowship meeting presentation).

1. ECG-beat segmentation
2.
