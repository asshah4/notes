What do you do when the outcome is HEAVILY reliant on a single exposure variable? 
Are the statistics performed differently? 

I think that the relationship is should then always be adjusted for the major exposure variable in all related analyses, otherwise there is some degree of bias.

Need to read [Greenland2016](../literature/Greenland2016.md) to better consider this
