Mendelian randomization (MR) may become useful for the aims for my [K23-overview](../permanent/K23-overview.md). 
There are multiple types of MR studies (such as one- and two-sample studies), multiple assumptions, and multiple methods to handle the assumptions. 

- @Bennett2017 and @Davies2018 introduce evaluation and reading MR studies
- @Bowden2015 and @Bowden2016 evaluate the use of invalid instruments and how to handle the estimations
- @Burgess2015 goes over how to perform multivariable MR
