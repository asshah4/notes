In the aims of my [K23-plan](../permanent/K23-plan.md) approach, phenotyping AF is a major theme. 

During the [T32- and-F32-research-years](../permanent/T32-%20and-F32-research-years.md) at UIC, the electrophysiology faculty were considering the role of substrate mapping in AF to help phenotype AF outcomes. 
One idea generated was to use electroanatomical mapping data to assess voltage/area indices as a way to assess the atrial substrate.
