flecainide and sotalol response
missing data of AF 
have ECG, Holter, loop at random
Have AFEQT
have echo data?

The treatment response for atrial fibrillation can be measured across three different axes:

1. Symptoms = perception of quality of life, include exertional capacity, cardiovascular hemodynamics, and psychological correlations that contribute
1. Structural = atrial remodeling, positive and negative, in setting of atrial fibrillation
1. Functional = characteristics defined by the elecrical capacity for maintaining atrial fibrillation

Interventions or treatment strategies include:

- increasing rate control with VW II or VW IV agents
- rhythm control strategy with initiation of VW I or III agents
- electrical cardioversion
- pulmonary vein isolation
- AV nodal ablation with cardiac resynchronization therapy
