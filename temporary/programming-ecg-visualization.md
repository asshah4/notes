Can a 12-lead ECG be mapped onto a virtual geometrical space that helps to allow for localization of certain cardiac features?  This concept is based on the idea of [ECG imaging](https://www.ecg-imaging.org/home) which attempts to reconstitute body surface ECGs onto the heart.

However, the ECGI interest is focused on using and localizing tissue in a way to help identify anatomic substrates for potential ablation. While this is useful, it is impractical when looking at ECGs from simple 12-lead systems.

An alternative tool may be to help extrapolate from a 12-lead ECG the same decision rules we use visually to help understand the electrical flow in the heart.

The major challenges would be ....

1. Individual sinus beat identification and abnormal beat identification, e.g. atrial and ventricular ectopy
1. Anatomic mapping structure (e.g. scaffold for electricity to be mappted to)

# Anatomy

The hardest part I think will be in rendering a map object of the heart. Should it be 3 dimensions? Should it be just precordial leads?
