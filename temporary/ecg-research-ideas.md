1. Programmatic approach to visualize ECG rhythm patterns, particularly that of PVC and localization. [[programming-ecg-visualization]]
1. RCA disease and bradycardia due to both conduction system ischemia and RV vagal predominant innervation. [[research-ecg-and-vagal-tone]]
1. Identify the types of PVCs and volume or frequency as a marker for mortality and/or depression. E.g. PVC burden increases in autonomic disorders such as PTSD and may help mediate increased mortality. [[research-pvc-and-mortality]]
