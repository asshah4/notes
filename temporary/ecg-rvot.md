Why does the RVOT seem to have an increase in overall arrhythmogenic potential?

- RVOT benign PVC
- Brugada syndrome
- Arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia (ARVD)
- Catecholaminergic polymorphic VT

There seems to be something about the RV outflow tract that has increase potential, whether is myocardiocytes or embryological differences in channel expressions. This seems to be found via differential understanding of early and late potentials in the RV (like fractionation or epsilon waves).
