## `R` and RStudio

I have been learning R since 2010, and have found it to be an excellent:

- open-source
- excellent community
- an outstanding IDE with [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/)
- package development

Currently using `r R.version$version.string`, nicknamed `r R.version$nickname`, with RStudio `1.3`.

## `git` and Github
