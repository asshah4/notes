		ECG signals as they related to EPS and ablation maps
			Can ECG signal predict contents of ablation maps?
			Can ECG signal before and after AF ablation predict success of ablations?
		Machine learning approach for ECG and EGM annotation
			Annotation of coronary sinus EGMs using WFDB system?
				Trainable in "real time" during EP study to some degree
				Similarly, could utilize CS to confirm ventricular activation as reflected by QRS complex
				P waves could be annotated to corresponding coronary sinus EGM
			Annotation system for EGM using a Shiny application?
				Could import several seconds of a clip and annotate (or adjust annotations)
				Would need to be able to save the annotations subsequently
	#autonomic
		Measuring ANS activity during EPS
			Where can we measure ANS activity during an EPS?
				Measure extracardiac activity from recordings from Vein of Marshall
				Measure directly from bilateral stellate ganglia
	#stress
		Mental stress testing
			Are there effects of mental stress that can be measured during EPS? Do they predict future arrhythmia?
		Pacing effects on cardiac function
			Does conduction system pacing improve diastology over RV pacing or biventricular pacing?
			Does demand pacing effect heart rate variability?
			Predict volume overload using a impedance change assessment in heart failure
				Rate of change of impedance with case/control based on time to first hospitalization
					Unclear however if this has already been done, and if there is a way to correlate this in a CareLink fashion (e.g. Medtronic)
