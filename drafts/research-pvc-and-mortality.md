Thinking about how PVC may be a sign of autonomic function or dysfunction, particularly changes in PVC burden.

PVC could be potentially localized to areas of scar. This may be identifiable on echocardiogram as areas of increased density in the myocardium. An ECG-based program to identify PVC locations, followed by assessment of myocardial fibrosis, may help to co-localize culprit regions prior to EP study.
