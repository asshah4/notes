Comparison of sympathetic and vagal effects on cardiac function:

| Parameter | SNS | PNS | Mechanism | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Chronotropy | &uarr; | &darr; | &uarr;SAN phase 4 slope d/t L-type Ca and I(funny) currents |
| Ventricular ERP | &darr; | &uarr; | SNS &uarr; NE & beta-adrenergic receptors; PNS &uarr; ACh inhibits NE release + &uarr;APD by muscarinic receptors |
| Automaticity | &uarr; | &darr; | SNS &uarr; NE & beta-adrenergic receptors; PNS &uarr; ACh inhibits NE release + &uarr;APD by muscarinic receptors |
| Dispersion | &uarr; | &darr; | SNS &rarr; heterogeneity in repolarization. PNS &rarr; reduces dispersion |
| Afterdepolarizations | &uarr; | &darr; | SNS &rarr; Ca++ overload. PNS &rarr;  &darr;Ca++ entry | 

### Neuropeptide Y

Potential pathway of NPY:
- Increase sympathetic tone leads to release of NPY, which leads to increase arrhythmia.
- NPY leads to vagolysis
- NPY binds to the Y2R, normally found in cholinergic neurons (vagal), normally found in RA and close to SA

Blockade:
- Y2R antagonist (blockade) may protect against vagolysis effects (and thus be anti-arrhythmic)
- NPY blockade may stop triggered activity in atrial arrhythmias
