This repository contains a merger of personal notes, documentation, and an R project to help convert some elements to an online format. It is primarily focused on the Obsidian-rooted *zettlekestan* method.

## Stage

The following stages are ways to help identify where a document exists in its life-span.  They are listed in what I believe is their sequential order.
